# Tests for functionality of addEdge method.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1
created graph graph2

# Add nodes to graph
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

added node n4 to graph2
added node n5 to graph2

# Connect the nodes together with edges.
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1

added edge e3 from n4 to n5 in graph2
added edge e4 from n5 to n4 in graph2

# Print the outgoing edges from n1 and n4
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2)
the children of n4 in graph2 are: n5(e3)
the children of n5 in graph2 are: n4(e4)
