# Tests for the handling of cyclic graphs

# Create a graph
created graph A
created graph B

# Add nodes to graph
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A
added node n3 to A
added node n4 to A
added node n5 to A
added node n6 to A

added node n7 to B
added node n8 to B
added node n9 to B

# Connect nodes together to create a cyclic graph
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in A
added edge e3 from n3 to n4 in A
added edge e4 from n4 to n5 in A
added edge e5 from n5 to n2 in A
added edge e6 from n5 to n6 in A

added edge e7 from n7 to n8 in B
added edge e8 from n8 to n9 in B
added edge e9 from n9 to n7 in B

# List the nodes of the graph
A contains: n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6
B contains: n7 n8 n9

# List the children of all the nodes
the children of n1 in A are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in A are: n3(e2)
the children of n3 in A are: n4(e3)
the children of n4 in A are: n5(e4)
the children of n5 in A are: n2(e5) n6(e6)
the children of n6 in A are:

the children of n7 in B are: n8(e7)
the children of n8 in B are: n9(e8)
the children of n9 in B are: n7(e9)
